    "For this “Hello World” example, you are working on a problem given to you by the manager of the Security Operations Center (SOC). It seems the SOC analysts are becoming inundated with “trivial” alerts ever since a new data set of indicators was introduced into the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. They have asked for your help in reducing the number of “trivial” alerts with- out sacrificing visibility.\n",
